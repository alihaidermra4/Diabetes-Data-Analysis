PROBLEM STATEMENT :
                Classify the women based on the provided features into those who are diabetes patients and those who are not.

Understanding Data :
                  All features are used to predict the outcome.
                  Outcome is the targeted data.
                  These features are used to categorize either a woman have diabetes or not.

Pre processing :
              Tackle with the NaN (Null value).
              See if there are any Ordinal series in dataset, do feature engineering.
              If the data is too spreaded, normalize it.
              Drop the duplicated data.
              Etc.

Model Training

K Nearest Neighbors
              The k-nearest neighbors algorithm, also known as KNN or k-NN, is a non-parametric, supervised learning classifier, which uses proximity to make classifications or predictions about the grouping of an individual data point. 
              While it can be used for either regression or classification problems, it is typically used as a classification algorithm, working off the assumption that similar points can be found near one another.

Support Vector Machine
              Also applied SVM algorithm on the dataset to check the accuracy.

Accuracy Score
              To check how much the predicted target and labeled target which were taken as testing data.
              The accuracy of model will increase with the increase in the amount  of dataset.
